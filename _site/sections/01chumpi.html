<p><strong>Chumpi and the Waterfall</strong> (<a href="http://www.teleandes.tv/">TeleAndes</a>) was filmed in the Achuar community of Chicherta in the Peruvian Amazon Rainforest, the last community on the Huasaga River before the border with Ecuador. This is a headwater area, where the forest is full of animals and the rivers teem with fish. Daily life is usually peaceful and calm.</p>

<p>Chumpi, with his father Secha and his grandfather Irar, make a trip to a sacred waterfall where both adults had received a vision as young men. Achuar lands, including this waterfall, are under threat from oil drilling. The Achuar believe oil drilling would contaminate its pure waters and the <em>Arutam</em> spirits which inhabit it would leave, and future generations would lose the power of their visions forever.</p>
