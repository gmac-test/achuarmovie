alt_text: A Family sits around the fire
---

The family shares quiet and intimate moments as they drink this tea sat around the fire, and parents take advantage of this time and the power of the wayus to give advice to their children and tell them the stories of the past. This daily ritual has led outsiders to refer to the Achuar as *the people of wayus*.
